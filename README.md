# GW2_Commanders_Watch
GW2 Commanders Watch is a simple but fast application for Guild Wars 2 (GW2) players to automatically monitor, process, and display combat log data generated by ArcDPS and Elite Insights. This tool aims to streamline the analysis of combat encounters, particularly for World vs. World (WvW) scenarios, by providing near real-time updates and historical data access within a Text-based User Interface (TUI).

A new run will automatically be created when a new log is detected in your arcDPS log folder, or the log will be added to the current run.
